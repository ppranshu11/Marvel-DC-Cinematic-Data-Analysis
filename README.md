**Marvel-DC-Cinematic-Data-Analysis || SQL, Power BI ||**


**The First Time We Met Superman**  
Remember the first time we saw Superman soar across the screen? It was like stepping into a whole new world. That awe-inspiring moment of seeing someone in that iconic cape triggered a sense of wonder that still sticks with us today. And then there’s Batman, with his legendary Batmobile, and Iron Man—genius, charm, and that unbeatable suit—each superhero making their own mark. The excitement, the trailers, the endless speculation… it wasn’t just a movie—it was an event that brought our childhood dreams to life. The Avengers? Seeing them team up in one grand saga was unforgettable.

**Team Marvel or Team DC? Celebrate the Magic of Storytelling**  
Whether you’re Team Marvel or DC, the stories, the battles, and the magic of these cinematic universes are something we all enjoy. But beyond the epic battles, there’s another kind of power at work: data. SQL and Power BI are the tools that help uncover the hidden patterns and stories behind these superhero worlds.

**How This Relates to Business**  
Just like superheroes fight to conquer their worlds, businesses aim to dominate their market. But while comic book heroes have superpowers, real-world success relies on data-driven insights and understanding your audience. And that’s where I come in! 

- **Market Domination**:  
  Curious about who wins the box office war—Marvel or DC? I can help businesses analyze competitors, spot trends, and find ways to grab their market share.

- **Understanding Your Audience**:  
  Like a superhero knowing their sidekick, businesses need to understand their customers. I can help segment audiences based on habits and preferences, ensuring businesses speak directly to their needs.

- **Optimizing Performance**:  
  Just as Hawkeye never misses, businesses need to hit their targets. I can track what’s working and what’s not, helping companies refine their strategies.

- **Turning Data into Stories**:  
  Companies often struggle with raw data. I transform it into clear stories and visuals, making it easy for everyone to understand and take action.

**The Journey Begins**  
The mission was simple: use SQL to clean, transform, and analyze data from Marvel and DC cinematic universes. This journey included data cleanup, creating tables, and using SQL queries to answer key questions. The end result? A dynamic Power BI dashboard bringing these insights to life.
